Change bullet points to actually be green, my fix did not work
Less space between bullet points
Make Hero-bg image reduced height
Make testimonial box larger
Make Typical Coaching Trajectory a numbered List
Change the tab image (icon in head, once svg file)
Hero header not so dark
Testimonials: if height is set, then width should adjust to fit (now lots of empty text, also only get full width if not enough breaks)
Contact page: put email sign in same line as email, get it in green

I changed the favicon but don't see it online? Should change the tab
