[x] Extend hero image to the left
[x] Add metatexts and keywords (and also good SEO and AI-search appearance)
If we want to complicate things.. Can we somehow figure out how to make the webpage in English and German? Optional

Testimonials on Coaching page:
One testimonial is clearly too long. Can we add [...] to be expanded? or read more.
Make largest testimonial box not go as wide with text (maybe 75% of page?)
Testimonials: if height is set, then width should adjust to fit (now lots of empty text, also only get full width if not enough breaks)

Think about what image would be nice for each page (workspace with clean desk and laptop, warm portrait forabout me, maube someone reading or writing notes at table, could also be image of notebook, graphic representing structure, walking path (progress), group in meeting or workshop setting, illustration of brainstorming, uni classroom or office environment, planner or calender, plant on a desk or mug with soft background)
