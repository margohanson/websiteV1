Change bullet points to actually be green, my fix did not work (color: #009C75)
Less space between bullet points
Make Hero-bg image (home page) reduced height and not go as dark
Contact page: put email sign in same line as email, get it in green
Change highlighted page you are on to green instead of blue (color: #009C75)
Add metatexts and keywords
If we want to complicate things.. Can we somehow figure out how to make the webpage in English and German? Optional
Add LVSC beropsregister logo to footer. likely clashes with colors though, so not sure what to do. Maybe worst case rounded grey box around it?
Make table with picture 1/3 and text 2/3 as variation

Testimonials on Coaching page:
One testimonial is clearly too long. Can we add [...] to be expanded? or read more.
Make largest testimonial box not go as wide with text (maybe 75% of page?)
Testimonials: if height is set, then width should adjust to fit (now lots of empty text, also only get full width if not enough breaks)

Think about what image would be nice for each page (workspace with clean desk and laptop, warm portrait forabout me, maube someone reading or writing notes at table, could also be image of notebook, graphic representing structure, walking path (progress), group in meeting or workshop setting, illustration of brainstorming, uni classroom or office environment, planner or calender, plant on a desk or mug with soft background)
