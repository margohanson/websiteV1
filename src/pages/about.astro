        <p>I believe that incredible change can come through open and honest conversations.</p>

        <p>
          After school, I moved abroad to study chemistry and conduct research. While talking to countless interesting
          people, I realized that I got a lot of energy from <b>helping others think, feel, and move forward more clearly through conversation</b>.
          Therefore, I decided to pursue a two-year
          <a href="https://www.counselling.nl/en/trainings/coaching-and-counselling-english-year-2/"><u>Coaching & Counselling education</u></a>
          and a training as
          <a href="https://devertrouwenspersoon.nl/opleiding/basisopleiding-vertrouwenspersoon/"><u>Confidential Advisor</u></a>
          alongside my PhD in crystal growth to learn how to support others professionally.
        </p>

        <p>
          I fell in love with coaching almost immediately. It allows me to combine my analytical thinking with my creativity,
          while also having a tangible, positive impact. I enjoy helping others disentangle their thoughts and figure out the next step forward together.
        </p>

        <p>
          While working with clients, I noticed that many people came to me with questions around <b>habits, routines, productivity, motivation, and stress</b>.
          This quickly became a natural focus, and one I genuinely enjoy.

              <p>I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult.</p>
              <p>
                Looking back, it is quite clear I always was neurodivergent, but the procrastination and overwhelm became a lot more severe in university.
                And when I started my PhD, the bit of external structure university provided fell away too. Starting tasks, especially ones requiring high
                levels of focus, sometimes felt almost impossible.
              </p>
              <p>
                The past years have been a journey of learning how my brain works, and what systems actually support it. So instead of beating myself up
                over the methods that supposedly <i>should</i> work (whether for neurotypical or neurodivergent people), I now focus on finding the ways
                that actually <i>do</i> - for <i>me</i>. I am still learning about me and my needs, but am already at a point I am happy with.
              </p>
              <p>
                This personal experience strongly shapes how I work as a coach: with <b>empathy, realism, and zero judgement</b>. I get how hard things can be,
                even when everyone else - and sometimes even yourself - doesn't get it.

        <h3 class="blueFont">How I Coach</h3>
        <p>People often describe me as <b>calm, grounded, direct, and non-judgemental</b>.</p>
        <p>
          In sessions, I aim to create a space that is supportive and honest at the same time. I may challenge you at times, but I will always respect your autonomy.
          You know your life best — my role is not to advise you, but to help you understand yourself better and find ways forward that <b>truly fit you</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I am a big fan of practical tools and iterative processes, lasting change often requires understanding and challenging deeper patterns and beliefs.
          Depending on what you are comfortable with and what you desire, our sessions can therefore be very diverse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, my goal is that you don’t need me anymore, because you’ve gained <b>clarity, tools that fit you, and the confidence to support yourself going forward</b>.
        </p>
        <p>If this resonates with you, I’d be happy to explore working together.</p>
