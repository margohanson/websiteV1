    <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto prose prose-lg">
    <p>
      Clients often come to me with questions like:

      <ul class="green-bullets space-y-1 [&>li]:my-0">
        <li>How do I stop procrastinating?</li>
        <li>How do I manage stress or overwhelm?</li>
        <li>How do I build habits that last?</li>
        <li>Why do I keep repeating the same patterns?</li>
        <li>How do I find clarity about my career or studies?</li>
        <li>How do I stay motivated when structure disappears?</li>
      </ul>   
      I am trained to work broadly across the following areas:<br>
      <b>Change | Personal life & health | Family & relationships | Career & team | Mourning, trauma & recovery.</b><br>
      This means you can bring <b>any topic</b> — even if it’s not something I list as a specialty. If I ever feel I’m not the right match for your situation, I’ll tell you honestly.

    </div>

    <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto prose prose-lg">
    <p>
      My approach is practical, <b>calm, structured, and empathetic</b>. I tailor each session to you, using:
      <ul class="green-bullets space-y-1 [&>li]:my-0">
        <li>reflective questions</li>
        <li>structured exercises</li>
        <li>practical tools</li>
        <li>iterative experiments</li>
        <li>clear goals and (optional) homework</li>
        <li>methodologies when helpful</li>
        <li>space for honest conversation</li>
      </ul>   
      We look beneath the surface when needed — because procrastination, stress, or lack of clarity often connect to deeper patterns. But everything is always at <b>your pace</b>.<br>
      I’m supportive but also direct. I might challenge your assumptions, but never your autonomy: <b>you know your life best — my role is to help you see it more clearly</b>.

                I worked with Ariane in coaching sessions over a longer period of time, and it helped me tremendously. She is a very empathetic and trustworthy person who listens carefully and guides you onto your own path through thoughtful, well-placed questions. She creates a comfortable atmosphere in which I was able to open up easily.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600">
                At a time when I felt very stuck and lost, she helped me bring more structure and routines back into my everyday life. She also supported me in figuring out what is important to me in life and in becoming more aware of my own needs.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600">
                I would definitely recommend Ariane and would always return to her if I found myself struggling again to deal with problems on my own, or if I needed someone who could look at things from a different perspective.

                Working with Ariane has been a genuinely valuable experience.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600">
                I started coaching without a clear end goal, but Ariane helped me untangle my thoughts and identify what I actually wanted to work on. From there, she guided me in building a few keystone habits that created space for creativity, brought more structure to my days, and helped me spend my time in ways that felt genuinely satisfying.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-600">
                She has a calm, perceptive way of noticing patterns, asking the right questions, and gently steering you toward more helpful approaches — all without judgement. Our sessions were collaborative and grounded, and over time, we built a personalised toolkit I now use to support both my creative work and my ADHD.
              </p>

              <!-- Continue reading -->
              <details class="text-gray-600 mt-2">
                <div class="space-y-2 mt-3">
                  <p>
                    We made mind maps, created matrixes and dopamine menus, talked about habit loops, and examined resistance in a way that felt grounded and doable. We also explored rituals, and experimented with small but effective routines. I began setting achievable writing goals — like 15-minute sprints with a coffee reward — and found myself not just getting more done, but actually enjoying the process again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We also looked at the mental health side of things: working through anxiety, tackling negative self-talk, and using visualisation exercises to find more calm when things felt overwhelming.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One small but incredibly helpful detail: she took notes during our sessions. That meant I could stay present in the moment, even when my thoughts were jumping around, and still walk away with a clear summary and practical next steps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What I’m taking away now is a more compassionate, practical way of supporting myself — and a set of tools I know I can come back to whenever I need a reset.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I’d definitely recommend working with Ariane if you’re looking for thoughtful, grounded support in making real, sustainable change.
