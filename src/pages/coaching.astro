    <p>
      Clients often come to me with questions like:

      <li class="text-red-500"><div class="text-black">How do I stop procrastinating?</div></li>

      <ul>
        <li class="text-red-500"><div class="text-black">How do I stop procrastinating?</div></li>
        <li>How do I manage stress or overwhelm?</li>
        <li>How do I build habits that last?</li>
        <li>Why do I keep repeating the same patterns?</li>
        <li>How do I find clarity about my career or studies?</li>
        <li>How do I stay motivated when structure disappears?</li>
      </ul>   
      I am trained to work broadly across the following areas:<br>
      <b>Change | Personal life & health | Family & relationships | Career & team | Mourning, trauma & recovery.</b><br>
      This means you can bring <b>any topic</b> — even if it’s not something I list as a specialty. If I ever feel I’m not the right match for your situation, I’ll tell you honestly.

    <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto prose prose-lg">
    <p>
      My approach is practical, <b>calm, structured, and empathetic</b>. I tailor each session to you, using:
      <ul>
        <li>reflective questions</li>
        <li>structured exercises</li>
        <li>practical tools</li>
        <li>iterative experiments</li>
        <li>clear goals and (optional) homework</li>
        <li>methodologies when helpful</li>
        <li>space for honest conversation</li>
      </ul>   
      We look beneath the surface when needed — because procrastination, stress, or lack of clarity often connect to deeper patterns. But everything is always at <b>your pace</b>.<br>
      I’m supportive but also direct. I might challenge your assumptions, but never your autonomy: <b>you know your life best — my role is to help you see it more clearly</b>.

                Working with Ariane has been a genuinely valuable experience.<br>
                I started coaching without a clear end goal, but Ariane helped me untangle my thoughts and identify what I actually wanted to work on. From there, she guided me in building a few keystone habits that created space for creativity, brought more structure to my days, and helped me spend my time in ways that felt genuinely satisfying.<br>
                She has a calm, perceptive way of noticing patterns, asking the right questions, and gently steering you toward more helpful approaches — all without judgement. Our sessions were collaborative and grounded, and over time, we built a personalised toolkit I now use to support both my creative work and my ADHD.<br>
                We made mind maps, created matrixes and dopamine menus, talked about habit loops, and examined resistance in a way that felt grounded and doable. We also explored rituals, and experimented with small but effective routines. I began setting achievable writing goals — like 15-minute sprints with a coffee reward — and found myself not just getting more done, but actually enjoying the process again.<br>
                We also looked at the mental health side of things: working through anxiety, tackling negative self-talk, and using visualisation exercises to find more calm when things felt overwhelming.<br>
                One small but incredibly helpful detail: she took notes during our sessions. That meant I could stay present in the moment, even when my thoughts were jumping around, and still walk away with a clear summary and practical next steps.<br>
                What I’m taking away now is a more compassionate, practical way of supporting myself — and a set of tools I know I can come back to whenever I need a reset.<br>
                I’d definitely recommend working with Ariane if you’re looking for thoughtful, grounded support in making real, sustainable change.<br>

                The coach taught me about some interesting and useful tools which I was not aware of to help me work with my ADHD traits and my perfectionist nature. Our conversations were always interesting and insightful and I felt comfortable having these conversations with her. The coach was very understanding, supportive and helped me in different ways. I always knew what to expect.<br>
                The coach used tangible tools which we worked together on to help support certain struggles I was having.<br>
                I have learnt some great tools from the coach which I will take forward as I continue to work on this. It was also extremely beneficial for me to have someone to talk to who understands, and who has a lot of knowledge of different tools which can benefit an ADHD brain.

            Coaching focuses on the present and future. Counselling looks at the past and how it influences you now. In practice, most people need a mix — and that is what my training covers.
