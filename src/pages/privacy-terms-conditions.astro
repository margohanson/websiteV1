        <p>
            I grew up in Germany and spent my entire adult life abroad, studying and working in science. I’m currently completing my PhD in chemistry, and for many years I thought research would be my long-term path.<br>
            But something else kept pulling me: <b>helping people one-on-one</b>.</br>
            Strangers opened up to me easily, friends regularly asked me to help them think through challenges, and I found myself far more energised by these conversations than by any experiment. So I decided to take that seriously.<br>
            I completed a two-year <a href="https://www.counselling.nl/en/trainings/coaching-and-counselling-english-year-2/"><u>Coaching & Counselling programme</u></a> and additional training as a <a href="https://devertrouwenspersoon.nl/opleiding/basisopleiding-vertrouwenspersoon/"><u>Confidential Advisor</u></a>. I have now been coaching individuals for three years.

            <p>
              My scientific background means I think analytically, logically, and structured — but I’m also highly creative, love crafting and reading fiction, and enjoy helping people see problems from new angles.<br>
