      <h2 class="blueFont">1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        These terms, conditions, and privacy provisions apply to all coaching and counselling services provided by
        <strong>Ariane Mader</strong> (the “Coach”) and are applicable to all clients (the “Client”).
        By booking, participating in, or paying for services, the Client agrees to these terms.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blueFont">2. Professional Framework</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Role and Standards</h3>
      <p>
        The Coach operates as a sole proprietorship registered in the Netherlands and is a registered
        member of the <strong><a href="https://www.lvsc.eu/"><u>LVSC (Landelijke Vereniging voor Supervisie en Coaching)</u></a></strong> in the Netherlands,
        working in accordance with its professional <a href="https://www.lvsc.eu/sites/default/files/2024-09/lvsc-gedragscode-2016-english-version.pdf"><u>Code of Conduct</u></a>.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Nature of Coaching and Counselling</h3>
      <p>
        Coaching and counselling are reflective and developmental process. They are
        <strong>not a substitute for psychotherapy, medical treatment, or crisis intervention</strong>,
        and are not intended to diagnose, treat, or cure mental health or medical conditions.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Scope of Services</h3>
      <p>
        Services may include individual coaching, counselling, and workshops.
        Sessions are primarily offered <strong>online</strong>. In-person sessions (for example
        walking sessions) may be agreed upon on a case-by-case basis.
      </p>

      <h3>2.4 Client Responsibility</h3>
      <p>
        Participation is voluntary and at the Client’s own responsibility. The Client remains
        responsible for their own active participation and progress between sessions, as well as their own physical and psychological boundaries. If support outside the
        scope of coaching appears necessary, the Coach may suggest referral to another qualified
        professional.
      </p>
