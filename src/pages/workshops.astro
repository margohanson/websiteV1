                Working with Ariane has been a genuinely valuable experience.<br>
                I started coaching without a clear end goal, but Ariane helped me untangle my thoughts and identify what I actually wanted to work on. From there, she guided me in building a few keystone habits that created space for creativity, brought more structure to my days, and helped me spend my time in ways that felt genuinely satisfying.<br>
                She has a calm, perceptive way of noticing patterns, asking the right questions, and gently steering you toward more helpful approaches — all without judgement. Our sessions were collaborative and grounded, and over time, we built a personalised toolkit I now use to support both my creative work and my ADHD.<br>
                We made mind maps, created matrixes and dopamine menus, talked about habit loops, and examined resistance in a way that felt grounded and doable. We also explored rituals, and experimented with small but effective routines. I began setting achievable writing goals — like 15-minute sprints with a coffee reward — and found myself not just getting more done, but actually enjoying the process again.<br>
                We also looked at the mental health side of things: working through anxiety, tackling negative self-talk, and using visualisation exercises to find more calm when things felt overwhelming.<br>
                One small but incredibly helpful detail: she took notes during our sessions. That meant I could stay present in the moment, even when my thoughts were jumping around, and still walk away with a clear summary and practical next steps.<br>
                What I’m taking away now is a more compassionate, practical way of supporting myself — and a set of tools I know I can come back to whenever I need a reset.<br>
                I’d definitely recommend working with Ariane if you’re looking for thoughtful, grounded support in making real, sustainable change.<br>

                The coach taught me about some interesting and useful tools which I was not aware of to help me work with my ADHD traits and my perfectionist nature. Our conversations were always interesting and insightful and I felt comfortable having these conversations with her. The coach was very understanding, supportive and helped me in different ways. I always knew what to expect.<br>
                The coach used tangible tools which we worked together on to help support certain struggles I was having.<br>
                I have learnt some great tools from the coach which I will take forward as I continue to work on this. It was also extremely beneficial for me to have someone to talk to who understands, and who has a lot of knowledge of different tools which can benefit an ADHD brain.
